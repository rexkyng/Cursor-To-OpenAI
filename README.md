# Cursor To OpenAI

Convert the Cursor Editor to an OpenAI API interface service.

## Introduction

This project provides a proxy service that converts the AI chat of the Cursor Editor into an OpenAPI API, allowing you to reuse the LLM of the Cursor in other applications.

## Preparsuitue

Visit [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com) and register a account.
    - 150 fast premium requests are given, which can be reset by deleting the account and then registering again
    - Suggest to use gmail/outlook email, some temp emails have been disabled by Cursor.

### Get Cursor client cookie

The cookie from Cursor webpage does not work in Cursor-To-OpenAI server. You need to get the Cursor client cookie following these steps:

1. Run `npm install` to initialize the environment。
2. Run `npm run login`. Open the URL shows in the log, and then login your account.
3. The cookie shows in your command is the `Curosr Cookie` value. Copy and save it to your notepad.

The log of this command looks like:
```
[Log] Please open the following URL in your browser to login:
https://www.cursor.com/loginDeepControl?challenge=6aDBevuHkK-HLiZ<......>k2lEjbVRMpg&uuid=5147ac09<....>5fe5f3aeb&mode=login      <-- Copy the url and open it in your browser.

```

#### API to get Cursor client cookie

We provide an API to save you from manual login. You need to log in to your Cursor account in browser and get `WorkosCursorSessionToken` from Application-Cookie📄
1. Get Cursor client cookie
    - Url：`http://localhost:3010/cursor/loginDeepContorl`
    - Request：`GET`
    - Authentication：`Bearer Token`（The value of `WorkosCursorSessionToken` from Cursor webpage)
    - Reponse: In JSON, the value of `accessToken` is the `Cursor Cookie` in JWT format. That's what you want.

Sample request:
```
import requests

WorkosCursorSessionToken = "{{{Repalce by your WorkosCursorSessionToken from cookie in browser}}}}"
response = requests.get("http://172.207.170.121:3010/cursor/loginDeepControl", headers={
    "authorization": f"Bearer {WorkosCursorSessionToken}"
})
data = response.json()
cookie = data["access_token"]
print(cookie)
```

                base_url="http://localhost:3010/v1")

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="claude-3-7-sonnet",
